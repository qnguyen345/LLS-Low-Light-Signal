# Low Light Signal Measurement
The theory and full data analysis will be done in the experimental report.

Note: The data files are in the same directory as the Python file.

**Experiment_3**: The goal of this experiment is to explore the effects and the role of time constants on measurement.
* The time constant (t) can be determined by fitting the data to the expression: f(x) = e^(-x/t)
* The code finds the observed time constant and plots that with an exponential decaying fit. 

**Experiment_9**: The goal of this experiment is to explore the effects of Johnson noise on a signal.
* Compares the decay of signal due to a 100kOhm and 10 kOhm resistors.
* Outputs the V_rms vs. Data Point graphs for each resistor values.
* Also outputs the average of the Johnson noise <dR^2>^(1/2) vs. Time Constants.
